## Course Description

CS161 introduces the principles of computer programming using an object oriented language. It includes problem-solving concepts, verification and validation, representation of numbers, sources of errors, debugging techniques and algorithm development.  The Java programming language is used.

## Prerequisite

CS160 Orientation to Computer Science, with a 'C' or better  
MTH95 Intermediate Algebra or equivalent with a 'C' or better

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of the course you will be able to:

1. Demonstrate an understanding of the differences between primitive data types and objects and their representation in Java.
1. Demonstrate the use of good program development, debugging techniques and documentation.
1. Write Java code that includes control statements, while loops, for loops, output to the screen and input from the keyboard and from a file.
1. Write, compile and run simple Applets and GUI Applications using components and containers.
1. Write simple, user-designed, classes that demonstrate an understanding of encapsulation.
1. Write Java code that includes the use of single-dimensional arrays.

## Required Course Materials

CS161 Worksheet Packet, Winter 2017 available in the college bookstore.

USB thumb drive with a minimum capacity of 4GB, required, available in the college bookstore, various local stores, or online at retailers such as [Amazon.com.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U213Y8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002U213Y8&linkCode=as2&tag=joeparisnet09-20&linkId=2AGPEW6DDCZZOLMQ)

Internet access, required, available in limited fashion in various college computer labs or through your local Internet service provider (ISP).

A text editor of your choice. The editor installed on the lab computers is [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com/download/).

[Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

## Class Policies

You will get the most from this class if you attend every day. Much of the material covered won't come directly from the book. A lot of your learning will involve class discussion which can only happen if you are present. Additionally, assignments, quiz or exam dates, and other important information may be announced in class.

You are expected to be prepared for each class, having completed all reading and homework assignments.  The course is extremely cumulative so a good start is essential.

This class will strongly emphasize *peer instruction* in which all students in the class will cooperatively and collaboratively learn the material. Again, you must be present in class and have read the assigned materials in order for this to be possible.

While in class, please set your cell phone to *vibrate*. If you need to take a call, please step out of the room to do so.

Assignments may not be submitted via e-mail.

## Programming Assignments

Programming assignments will be given throughout the quarter.

All programming assignments must include a "header" which includes your name, class name, date, assignment number and description. More details will be given in class.

All programming assignments must turned in at the beginning of the class period on the date due.

It is recommended that you use the computers in the labs in McKenzie Hall (MKH-105, MKH-103) or the Library Computer Lab. You are responsible for checking the lab schedule for its hours.

Alternately, you may use your own personal computers provided it has any required software installed.

Assignments may *not* be submitted via e-mail.

Instructions for submitting assignments will be given in class.

## Labs & Lab Worksheets

Worksheets are intended to be completed during the Lab session each week.  If you do not have sufficient time to complete the worksheet during the Lab session, you will be expected to finish it either at home or in one of the campus labs listed above.

Answers to worksheet questions should be typed using a word processor and handed in to the instructor either the day of the lab class or at the next regularly scheduled class session.

The worksheet's associated Java file will be turned in electronically.

Participation during Lab class will constitute 30% of the possible points for each worksheet.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will be given during the last class period of each week.

Missed quizzes cannot be made-up without instructor consent *prior* to the quiz.

The lowest quiz score will be dropped.

## Exams

There will be a cumulative exam given during the regularly scheduled final exam time during week 11 of the term.

## Missed Work

In case of absence from class, students are responsible for announcements made and materials covered.  If an absence results in a missed quiz, that quiz will be treated as the low score which is discarded when total points are calculated at the end of the term.

## Late Work & Late Tickets

No late work will be accepted. *Except....*

You will be given "Late Tickets" allowing an exception to the no late week rule for *one* written assignment, programming project, and worksheet.

To qualify for that exception you must cut out the late ticket and staple it to the assignment upon submission.

Unused late tickets may be redemed at the end of the term for 5 extra credit points each.

## Independent Work

As students, you are encouraged to discuss assignments and course materials with your peers. However, unless the assignment is a group project, the work you turn in to be graded must be yours and yours alone and you must be capable of explaining it verbally to the instructor if asked. If you received pointers or guidance from another student in the class you must clearly state that near the top of the assignment and list the names of everyone who helped. Written work that appears to be directly copied from another student will not be given credit.

## Tutors

Tutors are generally available for this and other computer science classes.  Check with the instructor and/or the Learning Center if you feel you need further assistance with this course.

## Incompletes

If you have satisfactorily completed most of the course work and have then encountered an emergency which, in the instructor's judgment, is sufficiently serious to warrant it, the instructor will prepare an Incomplete Agreement specifying the work that you will need to complete by the end of the following term in order to earn the credit for the class. The Agreement will specify a default grade based on the work which you have completed to date. In the case you do not fulfill the agreement the default grade will automatically be assigned at the end of the following term.

## Student Rights & Responsibilities

All students are expected to be familiar with the Student Rights and Responsibilities handbook, and to follow the conduct guidelines outlined. The handbook can be found on the LBCC Website, under Students/Students Rights.

## LBCC Center for Accessibility Resources

Students who may need accommodations due to documented disabilities, or who have medical information which the instructor should know, or who need special arrangements in an emergency, should speak with the instructor during the first week of class. If you believe you may need accommodation services, please contact the Center for Accessibility Resources, 541-917-4789. If you have documented your disability, remember that you must make your request for accommodations through the [Center for Accessibility Resources web page](https://www.linnbenton.edu/cfar) every term in order to receive accommodations.
